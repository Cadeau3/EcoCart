📱 EcoCart — Sustainable Shopping Advisor (Android-Style UI)

EcoCart empowers households to make sustainable and budget-friendly shopping decisions through simple price comparisons and real-time eco-impact analysis.

EcoCart is a lightweight, mobile-friendly web application designed with a clean minimal Android/Samsung-style UI, allowing users to compare Kenyan grocery products based on price, packaging impact, recyclability, carbon footprint, and overall eco-score.
The app runs fully client-side, works offline, and saves favorites locally — no backend required.
